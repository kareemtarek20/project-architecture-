## üöÄ Quick Start

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fajarghifar/inventory-management-system
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project folder:**

    ```bash
    cd inventory-management-system
    ```

3. **Install PHP dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

4. **Copy `.env` configuration:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5. **Generate application key:**

    ```bash

    ```

6. **Configure the database in the `.env` file** with your local credentials.

7. **Run database migrations and seed sample data:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
    ```

8. **Link storage for media files:**

    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

9. **Install JavaScript and CSS dependencies:**

    npm install && npm run dev
    ```

10. **Start the Laravel development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

11. **Login using the default admin credentials:**

    - **Email:** `admin@admin.com`
    - **Password:** `password`

12. **Design patterns used in this project**
    Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. They represent best practices refined over time. Here's an overview of **four main types of design patterns**:

---

### 1. **Creational Design Patterns**

**Purpose**: Deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

**Common Patterns**:

* **Singleton**: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access.
* **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
* **Abstract Factory**: Produces families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
* **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation.
* **Prototype**: Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

---

### 2. **Structural Design Patterns**

**Purpose**: Deal with object composition‚Äîhow objects can be combined to form larger structures.

**Common Patterns**:

* **Adapter**: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
* **Bridge**: Separates an object‚Äôs abstraction from its implementation.
* **Composite**: Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
* **Decorator**: Adds new functionality to an object dynamically.
* **Facade**: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.
* **Flyweight**: Reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
* **Proxy**: Provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object.

---

### 3. **Behavioral Design Patterns**

**Purpose**: Focus on communication between objects and how responsibilities are distributed.

**Common Patterns**:

* **Observer**: Defines a dependency between objects so that when one changes state, all its dependents are notified.
* **Strategy**: Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable.
* **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing parameterization of clients with queues, requests, or logs.
* **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes requests along a chain of handlers until one handles it.
* **Mediator**: Centralizes complex communication between related objects.
* **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* **Template Method**: Defines the program skeleton in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

---

### 4. **Concurrency (or Multithreading) Patterns**

**Purpose**: Deal with multi-threaded programming paradigms and safe concurrent access to resources.

**Common Patterns**:

* **Thread Pool**: Manages a pool of worker threads to perform tasks, improving performance.
* **Producer-Consumer**: Coordinates communication between threads that produce and consume data.
* **Read-Write Lock**: Allows concurrent read access but exclusive write access to resources.
* **Double-Checked Locking**: Reduces the overhead of acquiring a lock by first testing the locking criterion.
